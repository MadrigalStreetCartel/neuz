# Usage

1. Start Neuz
2. Press `Play`
3. Select a playstyle
4. Adjust settings to your liking
5. Press `ENGAGE`

## Engagement Behavior

- Automation will take over your cursor as soon as the game window is focused.
- Unfocusing the game window (e.g. <kbd>ALT+TAB</kbd>) will pause the automation until the game window is focused again.
- Pressing `DISENGAGE` will fully stop the automation.

## Farming Automation

Use farming automation if you're trying to level up your character or farm sets, quest items, penya, etc.

Works best if you're in a densely populated farming area.

### Requirements

No settings have to be changed by default.

1. Use default theme (used by default)
2. Enable auto-attack (enabled by default)

For optimal performance (optional and not necessarily needed):

1. Enable right-click player menu (disabled by default)
2. Disable single-click to attack (disabled by default)
3. Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> a few times before engaging to clear all UI elements that are in the way. You can press `T` to bring the player stats up again, as those don't interfere with automation.

### Slot Configuration

If you're using slot-dependent actions such as `On-Demand Pickup Pet` or `Use Skills to Attack`, make sure to configure the slot bar in Neuz accordingly.

| Slot Symbol | Flyff Equivalent |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| üçî         | Food Item        |
| üê∂         | Pickup Pet       |
| üó°Ô∏è         | Attack Skill     |
