## Farming Automation

Use farming automation if you're trying to level up your character or farm sets, quest items, penya, etc.

Works best if you're in a densely populated farming area.

### Requirements

No settings have to be changed by default.

1. Use default theme -> Gold (used by default) 
2. Enable auto-attack (enabled by default)

For optimal performance (optional and not necessarily needed):

1. Disable weather, event effects.
3. Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> a few times before engaging to clear all UI elements that are in the way. 
3. Take a look at #How-To channel on discord for a full setup tutorial.

## Support Automation
- Fill the slots as desired (Heal spell for the target you wanna heal, Food/Pills for yourself).
- Target the character you want to follow in game.
- Engage
