# Development

Prerequisites:
- Install a recent `nodejs` version (should work fine with the latest version)
- Install `yarn` (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Install `rustup` (https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install the latest stable Rust version via rustup: `rustup install stable`

Building:
- Create build folder in the root directory
- Run `yarn` in the root directory to install dependencies
- Run `yarn tauri dev` to start the app in development mode
- Run `yarn tauri build` to build the app for production

Before pushing:
- run `cargo clippy` in the `src-tauri` directory to check for linting errors
- run `cargo fmt` in the `src-tauri` directory to format the code

# Usage

1. Start Neuz as an admin
2. Choose or create your profile
3. Press `Play`
4. Select a playstyle
5. Adjust settings to your liking
6. Press `ENGAGE`

## Engagement Behavior

- Automation will start as soon as you `ENGAGE`.
- Pressing `DISENGAGE` will fully stop the automation.
- Fully workable in background since 0.15.0

## Farming Automation

Use farming automation if you're trying to level up your character or farm sets, quest items, penya, etc.

Works best if you're in a densely populated farming area.
It will also use an AOE attack skill (if configured) when the bot is close to the target.

### Requirements

No settings have to be changed by default.

1. Use default theme -> Gold (used by default) 
2. Enable auto-attack (enabled by default)

For optimal performance (optional and not necessarily needed):

1. Disable weather, event effects.
3. Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> a few times before engaging to clear all UI elements that are in the way. 
3. Take a look at #How-To channel on discord for a full setup tutorial.

## Support Automation
##### Stand-alone support:
- Fill the slots as desired (Heal spell for the target you wanna heal, Food/Pills for yourself).
- Target the character you want to follow in game.
- Press Z to follow character
- Engage


##### Party support:
It will follow the party leader by automatically selecting it from the party window, to make it work:
- Enable the "Is it in a party?" toggle under settings
- Position the party window names list in the top right corner and shrink it as much as possible from sides and below
- Make sure to close all party windows before engaging.
- Engage.
It will also use F1 + C (action slot) to self-buff based on the "interval between buffs" timer.
